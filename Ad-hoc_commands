To use ansible commands, The remote node should have python installed.
Multiple hosts/Inventorys
ansible -i beta/hosts -i alpha/hosts all_servers -m ping
ansible -i beta/hosts -i alpha/hosts all_servers -a free
ansible -i beta/hosts -i alpha/hosts all_servers -a 'cat /etc/passwd'

Used to execute one task.
#ansible all -m ping
#ansible all -m shell -a "cmd1;cmd2;cmd3"
#ansible  all -m ping --list-hosts

Use a copy module to copy files/data from Ansible Engine to Nodes.
#ansible all -m copy -a "src=source/path dest=dest/path mode='0755' "
[Here directory structure will also be created in the destination]

#ansible all -m copy -a "src=source/path dest=dest/path mode='0755'  flat=yes"
[Here directory structure will not be created in the destination]

#ansible all -m file -a "content=text data in a file dest=/tmp/testfile.txt"
[Creating a file directly with some content]

#ansible all -m file -a "path=path/of/file  state=touch  mode='0755' "
#ansible all -m file -a "path=path/of/file  state=directory  mode='0755' "
#ansible all -m file -a "path=path/of/file  state=absent"

Use fetch module to copy file/data from node to ansible Engine
#ansible all -m fetch -a "src=source/path  dest=/tmp/in/master/server flat=yes "
#ansible all -m fetch -a "src=source/path  dest=/tmp/{{inventory_hostname}}_file.txt flat=yes "
